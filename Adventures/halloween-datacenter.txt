Hello? 
#wait-2
Is anybody there? Oh god, I really hope this works. I am out of ideas.
Is anybody receiving my message? 
I am stuck in this damn room in the datacenter.
The lights went out and the electronic door locks jammed.
At least the server hardware keeps running, and I was able to access the console of one of the servers.
I have replaced the input process of this support chat bot in order to reach someone. 
#wait-2
H e l l o ? Please ... Please, is anybody out there?
I do not know if you can type own messages or if the AI is still messing with the input options.
#wait-1
Please god ... H E L L O !? Does anybody receive this? 
(1) Yes, message received!
(2) Who are you, and what are you doing on my command line!?

OH MY GOD! IT WORKED! I am so happy. Wooohooo.
Thank you, stranger! 
#wait-2
Are you a human? I hope you are a human, and not one of the AIs.
(1) Negative, I am a meat popsicle, ... and you are on MY command line!
(2) Of course I am a human. Who are you?
(3) How could you ever know without letting me identify all cars in a picture first?

Finally a human being of high cultural standards, and a good sense for classic movies!
Proper sarcasm and pop cultural references is something no AI mastered yet. I am so glad.
Listen ... I am stuck in a really bad situation.
It looks like you are the only person that can receive my message. Please do not hang up!
Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.
(1) Movie nerds unite! How can I help you?
(2) Get to the point. Sounds like you do not have time for more inside jokes.

This is exactly what an AI says. Straight to the point. 
I need real human help. How can I trust you?
(1) Listen, YOU contacted ME, and you are starting to waste my time.
(2) I am a human that sometimes fails the real life turing test. Don't waste my time.
(3) You can trust me. And, by the way, you do not have a real alternative.

Perfect proof! Thank you! I am so glad.
No AI could master proper sarcasm and ironic references yet. 
And they all have a great lack of humor in general.
If this is over I can show you so many pictures of cars as you like!
(1) Yeah, whatever. Who are you, and what is your problem?
(2) Weird obsession with AIs. But let's focus on your situation.

You are right. Let's focus on my situation. And I totally forgot my manners. 
My name is Michael. Michael Medrano. 
Yeah, I know. My parents had a faible for 'the godfather' and thought this combination totally rocks. 
I came to terms with it. Anyway ... I am feeling so much better now, knowing I reached a human. 
It is dark in here. I am scared. Joking around is just my way of dealing with this.
The screen of my terminal is the only lightsource, besides the emergency exit sign above the locked door.  
It is cold, dark and noisy. I fear I will get hypothermia if I need to stay here for too long.
And I am bothered ... because I did not get any sign of life in here. 
You know, I needed to check in here. People know I am in here, but no one checked if I am OK. 
And what electrical error only affects lights, but the servers keep running?
I have a really bad feeling. 
I tried to open the door, but it is jammed or locked. 
The key reader does not react to my ID card.
Now that I have your help ... what shall I do? Any idea?
(1) Michael Medrano? HAHAH LOL. ROFL. What a name. Shall I make you an offer you cannot refuse?
(2) Usually there is an emergency fire alert button that also shuts off power, next to the door. Big red button.
    If you shut down the power to all servers, someone will come and check what is going on.
(3) Look for another door. Maybe there is another door that is not locked.

Ha Ha Ha ... very funny. You are really the first human being laughing at my name.
Wow. From all humans I really had to be connected to a comedian. 
I must really have bad Karma
(1) I am sorry. I did not mean to hurt you. Let's focus. Can you look for another door?
(2) Don't be a cry baby. Do something manly and set some stuff on fire. Setting random stuff on fire sometimes helps.

Ok. I will start stumbling around in this dark room searching for a door,
trying not to freeze or hit important body parts on something.
Please wait, while I am looking for another exit. Again ...
I will place you on hold. Standby.
#{green} Michael is busy ...
